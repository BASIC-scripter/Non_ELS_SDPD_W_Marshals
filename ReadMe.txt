Hello Everybody,

This pack has been an ongoing project for close to a year now but it has finally been completed to the best of My Ability. I tried to capture as good as I could a good amount of the vehicle fleet that the LAPD uses.

Big Thanks to ShadowShifter and Stoppel for the Liveries and Carcol work to get the light patterns and liveries accurate to the IRL versions as well as Big Thanks to the beta testers to work out all the issues I hadn't seen when originally creating the vehicles.

The Vehicle List is as follows:

- 2000 Chevy Tahoe
- 2008 Ford CVPI
- 2011 Ford CVPI
- 2011 Ford CVPI Slick top
- 2014 Dodge Charger
- 2015 Ford Taurus
- 2015 Ford Taurus Slick top
- 2015 Ford Explorer
- 2015 Ford Explorer SWAT Slick top
- 2016 Ford Explorer
- 2016 Ford Explorer SWAT Slick top
- 2020 Ford Explorer
- 2020 Ford Explorer SWAT Slick top
- Lenco Bear cat SWAT
- Pierce Mobile Command Unit SWAT

I tried to standardize the Extra's list as well to make it easier between the models

Extra 1 = Ram bar (If applicable)
Extra 2 = Working Driver Side Spotlight
Extra 3 = Passenger Side Spotlight Up
Extra 4 = Passenger Side Spotlight Down
Extra 8 = Front Responding Lights (Roof bar)
Extra 9 = On Scene Light Pattern (Recommend Turning off Extra 8, 10, 11 and 12)
Extra 10 = TA Traffic Bar center to out (Must have Extra 8 on to work)
Extra 11 = TA Traffic Bar Right to Left (Must have Extra 8 on to work)
Extra 12 = TA Traffic Bar Left to Right (Must have Extra 8 on to work)

Frequently Asked Questions:
- Can you add XYZ vehicle to the pack?
I will possibly add more vehicles but in the far future.

-My Lights are not working correctly
Make sure you do not have a conflicting Carcol ID with another vehicle

-Can you make this ELS?
There are no plans to make an ELS version. There are really good ELS LAPD Packs out there already by other devs such as Walters

- Do they have LOD's?
Sadly they do not as I am very lazy to do it. No excuse, just lazy

Thanks Everyone and Hope you Enjoy
